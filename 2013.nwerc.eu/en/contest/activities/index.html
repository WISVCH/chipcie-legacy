        <h2><a id="event-2"></a>Beer tasting (Cost: 5 euro)</h2>
        
        A long time ago, Delft had the most Beer brewers of any city in the Netherlands. Later the water that streamed through Delft became to soiled to brew beer with.  Nowadays there is again one beer brewer in Delft. The beer culture that use to have is still noticeable today. There are many café’s that serve over a hundred different kinds of beers. Because of this we thought it appropriate to give contestants and coaches the opportunity to taste some different beers.  You will walk to one of the characteristic beer houses of Delft:  “ ‘t Proeflokaal”,  where you will taste several different beers. The ward will tell you something about these beers during the tasting and some snacks will be served.

Costs: 5 Euros
    
        <h2><a id="event-1"></a>Guided tour of Delft</h2>
        
        The city center of Delft dates back to the Dark Ages. The height of the city’s international wealth and fame was the 17th century. In this period the Netherlands made immense profits from international trade and it is referred to as  ‘The Golden Age’ of the Netherlands. As you would expect, is the inner city of Delft  a collection of beautifully decorated buildings from this period. During the tour a guide will tell you about some of these buildings such as the ‘Oude Jan’ (Old church) and the town hall. Also, the tour will visit the new church, where members of the Dutch Royal family are buried. If you wish you can climb the stairs to the tower where you will have a fine sight of the city.
Costs: none
