1.The team with the most correctly solved problems. 
2.The team with the least total time. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The 
time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the 
accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time. There is 
no time consumed for a problem that is not solved. 
3. The team that first submitted its last accepted problem is ranked higher. In case a tie still remains, the team 
that first submitted its second-last accepted problem is ranked higher, and so on. In the event that this does not 
resolve the tie, the ranks will be determined by chance.

through the 'clarification requests'.
